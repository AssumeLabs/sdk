## 🧠 Core Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**  
  Independent agents collaborate to analyze, reason, and validate insights in real time.

- **Live Signal Analysis**  
  Processes continuous data streams from dynamic environments.

- **Pattern Detection**  
  Identifies hidden structures, correlations, and emerging trends.

- **Probability Prediction**  
  Generates probabilistic forecasts instead of static outputs.

- **Accuracy Tracking**  
  Continuously measures and improves prediction performance over time.
